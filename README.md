# Sortable List Example
Just an example of a list that can be sorted using drag and drop. Both drag and touch events are supported. Dragging is enabled only when the cursor/finger is over the drag handle.

Works with lists longer than the viewport. Scrolling is triggered when the cursor/finger is 50 pixels from the top/bottom of the viewport.
